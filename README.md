# Nearest-Neighbor-GPX
Takes a list of coordinates and creates a GPX file of the optimal path.

Calculates the distance between two coordinates using the Haversine Formula.

This does not work yet. It returns a value, but it is not necessarily the most optimal path.

Problems to fix:
- RUNTIME
- Making sure it actually works
- More and more tests!
